# Film Website

This is a simple film website that displays a list of movies and their details, allowing users to buy tickets for available showings.

## Getting Started

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How it Works

The website fetches data from the following API: https://api.npoint.io/0b2aef194151f5771a43/films/. It then renders this data to the webpage using JavaScript. Each film is displayed as a clickable list item. When a film is clicked, a card containing more detailed information about the film is displayed. Users can also "buy" tickets for each film by clicking a button on the film's card.

# Styling
The website is styled using the style.css file. This file contains styles for the following elements:

Body
Div
UL
LI
Film-card
Active
